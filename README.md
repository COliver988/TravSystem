# TravSystem
## Plans
This will be a standalone website that users can run locally using SQLite to persist data
I plan on complete system generation eventually

## To run locally
Download the software (there is an option in the repo to download)
Go to the application directory (Travsystem) in a command prompt way
 - Mac use bash
 - Windows terminal or powershell
enter `dotnet run` and it should start up
load a browser and go to https://localhost:32769/
